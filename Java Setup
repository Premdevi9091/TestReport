Step 1: Set Up Your Java Project in Eclipse
Create a new Java project:

Open Eclipse.
Go to File > New > Java Project.
Name your project, e.g., JiraAPICallProject, and click Finish.
Create a new Java class:

Right-click on the src folder > New > Class.
Name the class JiraAPIHandler and include the public static void main(String[] args) method.
Click Finish.
Add Required Libraries:

Right-click on your project > Build Path > Configure Build Path.
Go to Libraries > Add External JARs.
Add the following libraries:
Apache Commons CSV for handling CSV files.
Gson for JSON parsing.


Key Points in the Code
Bearer Token Authentication: The Bearer token is set in the Authorization header for both API calls.
CSV Handling: Apache Commons CSV is used for reading the input CSV and writing the output CSV.
JSON Parsing: Gson is used to parse JSON responses and extract needed information.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to manage response codes and connection issues.

How to Run the Project
Set your Jira Base URL: Replace your_base_url_here with your Jira instance's URL.
Set your Bearer Token: Replace your_bearer_token_here with your actual Bearer token for Jira authentication.
Input CSV File: Ensure input.csv is available in the project directory or adjust the path in the code.
Run the Project: Right-click on the JiraAPIHandler.java file > Run As > Java Application.
